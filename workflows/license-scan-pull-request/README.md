# Scan for license violations

This workflow validates that dependencies in your project do not violate approved licenses (or that they have been manually reviewed).

In order to do this, it uses [licensed](https://github.com/github/licensed), which is an open-source tool maintained by GitHub. To make use of it, it's worth reading through the readme of that project to get a sense for how it works and how it's configured.
