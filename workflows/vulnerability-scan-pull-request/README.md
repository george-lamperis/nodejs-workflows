## Vulnerability scan

This workflow prevents you from merging PRs that include vulnerable dependencies.

It runs when a Pull Request is opened or new code is pushed to a pull request.

## Configuration

See the [vulnerability-scan action](https://github.com/actions/vulnerability-scan) for configuration options.

## Ecosystem support

Currently  we only support `package-lock.json` files in the `npm` package manager ecosystem
