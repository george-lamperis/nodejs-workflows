# Welcome first-time contributors

This workflow welcomes first-time contributors to your project.

In order to use it, you'll need a `WELCOME_COMMENT` secret on your repository. It can be anything you'd put in a repository issue or pull request comment, so Markdown will be properly rendered to welcome your new contributors!
